For every gallon of milk that a customer demands that you don’t carry (random demand $x$ exceeds supply $S$), you incur a cost of $p$ (effectively the missed sales revenue amounting to the difference between your sales price and purchase price). \n",

    "### 1. Compare the behavior of Q-Learning and Double Q-Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the provided plot, we observe a significant difference in the performance of the two algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Q-Learning (Orange): There is a significant positive spike in the estimated value of $Q(A, a_1)$ during the first 100 episodes, reaching approximately **+0.12**. Since the true expected reward for reaching state $B$ and taking any action is **-0.1**, this indicates a severe **maximization bias** where the agent is consistently overestimating the value of the state.\n",
    "* Double Q-Learning (Blue): Remains much more stable and keeps the estimate near zero or slightly negative throughout the training process. By successfully mitigating the overestimation \"hump,\" it tracks the true expected value of the MDP much more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Explain why Q-Learning can exhibit maximization bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this specific MDP, state $B$ has $n=10$ actions ($b_1, \\dots, b_{10}$) with rewards drawn from a distribution with mean $-0.1$ and variance $1.0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to high variance, in any given episode, at least one of these actions is likely to return a positive reward by pure chance. Because Q-Learning utilizes the maximum of these noisy estimates for its updates, it erroneously identifies these random positive outliers as the \"best\" path. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a result of Jensen's Inequality, which states $E[\\max(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n)] \\geq \\max(E[X_1], E[X_2], \\dots, E[X_n])$. In a stochastic environment, the expected value of the maximum is almost always greater than the maximum of the expected values, leading to systematic overestimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Discuss the advantages and possible drawbacks of Double Q-Learning in general MDPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages: \n",
    "1. Since $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are updated with different samples, the noise in action selection is decoupled from the noise in evaluation, resulting in unbiased estimates.\n",
    "2. By not \"chasing\" random positive spikes, the agent's policy remains more stable and is less likely to converge prematurely to a sub-optimal action.\n",
    "3. As shown in the graph, the values can and should go negative if the expected rewards are negative. Double Q-Learning reflects this environmental reality much faster than standard Q-Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "1. The requirement to store two complete Q-tables increases memory consumption. \n",
    "2. There is a slight increase in computational cost per update to manage two separate value approximations.\n",
    "3. In deterministic environments where bias is not an issue, the convergence rate can be slower because updates are distributed between two tables, effectively reducing the learning frequency per table."
