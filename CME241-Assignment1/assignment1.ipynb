    "## Question 1: Snakes and Ladders (Led by Yusuke)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the classic childhood game of Snakes and Ladders, all players start to the left of square 1 (call this position 0) and roll a 6-sided die to represent the number of squares they can move forward. The goal is to reach square 100 as quickly as possible. Landing on the bottom rung of a ladder allows for an automatic free-pass to climb, e.g. square 4 sends you directly to 14; whereas landing on a snake's head forces one to slide all the way to the tail, e.g. square 34 sends you to 6. Note, this game can be viewed as a Markov Process, where the outcome is only depedent on the current state and not the prior trajectory. In this question, we will ask you to both formally describe the Markov Process that describes this game, followed by coding up a version of the game to get familiar with the RL-book libraries.\n",

    "At Lilypad 1: Both Action A and Action B carry the exact same risk of immediate death (1/n). However, Action A only allows the frog to reach Lilypad 2, while Action B offers a uniform probability of landing anywhere in the pond (including escaping immediately). Because the potential reward of Action B is higher for the same level of risk, Action B is optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "At Lilypad 13: The frog is safe from immediate death if it chooses Action A (it moves to 12 or 14). Action B, however, always carries a 1/n risk of jumping back to 0 (death). Since the frog is already deep in the pond, the \"shortcut\" offered by B is not worth the risk of dying. Therefore, Action A is optimal."

Then manually calculate $q_k(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ and $v_k(\\cdot)$ from $v_{k - 1}(\\cdot)$ using the Value Iteration update, and then calculate the greedy policy $\\pi_k(\\cdot)$ from $q_k(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ for $k = 1$ and $k = 2$ (hence, 2 iterations).\n",

Now argue that $\\pi_k(\\cdot)$ for $k > 2$ will be the same as $\\pi_2(\\cdot)$. *Hint*: You can make the argument by examining the structure of how you get $q_k(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ from $v_{k-1}(\\cdot)$. With this argument, there is no need to go beyond the two iterations you performed above, and so you can establish $\\pi_2(\\cdot)$ as an Optimal Deterministic Policy for this MDP.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Question 1:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Answer: True**\n",
    "* **Justification:** Let the original immediate reward be $R$. The definition of the Q-value is:\n",
    "$$Q^\\pi(s, a) = R + \\gamma \\left[ 0.5 V^\\pi(s_1) + 0.5 V^\\pi(s_2) \\right] = 5$$\n",

    "$$Q'_{new} = (R + 2) + \\gamma \\left[ 0.5 V^\\pi(s_1) + 0.5 V^\\pi(s_2) \\right]$$\n",
    "Rearranging the terms to group the original equation:\n",
    "$$Q'_{new} = \\underbrace{\\left( R + \\gamma [0.5 V^\\pi(s_1) + 0.5 V^\\pi(s_2)] \\right)}_{Q^\\pi(s, a) = 5} + 2$$\n",

    "* **Justification:** The Bellman operator $B^\\pi$ is a $\\gamma$-contraction mapping with respect to the $L_\\infty$-norm (max-norm). By the **Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**, any contraction mapping on a complete metric space guarantees the existence of a unique fixed point.

    "    * **Counterexample:**\n",
    "        Consider a state $s$ with two actions, $a_1$ and $a_2$.\n",
    "        * Action $a_1$ yields a value of 5 ($Q^\\pi(s, a_1) = 5$).\n",
    "        * Action $a_2$ also yields a value of 5 ($Q^\\pi(s, a_2) = 5$).\n",
    "        * The current policy $\\pi$ chooses $a_1$, so $V^\\pi(s) = 5$.\n",
    "    * **The Update Step:**\n",
    "        The new policy $\\pi'(s)$ is chosen by $\\arg\\max_a Q^\\pi(s, a)$.\n",
    "        $$\\pi'(s) = \\arg\\max(5, 5)$$\n",
    "        Whether the new policy picks $a_1$ or switches to $a_2$, the value of the new policy remains 5.\n",
    "        $$V^{\\pi'}(s) = 5$$\n",
    "    * **Conclusion:** Since $V^{\\pi'}(s) = V^\\pi(s) = 5$, the policy did not strictly improve; it stayed the same (converged).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 5:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Answer: True**\n",
    "* **Justification:** The state-value function $V^\\pi(s)$ is the expectation of the Q-values over the policy's action distribution:\n",
    "$$V^\\pi(s) = \\sum_{a} \\pi(a|s) Q^\\pi(s, a)$$\n",
    "If $Q^\\pi(s, a) = 10$ for all $a$, we can factor out the constant:\n",
    "$$V^\\pi(s) = 10 \\cdot \\sum_{a} \\pi(a|s)$$\n",
    "Since probabilities sum to 1 ($\\sum \\pi(a|s) = 1$), it follows that $V^\\pi(s) = 10 \\cdot 1 = 10$. This holds for any stochastic or deterministic policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 6:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Answer: True**\n",
    "* **Justification:** Assume the rewards are bounded by a constant $R_{\\max}$ (i.e., $|R_i| \\leq R_{\\max}$). The absolute value of the return is bounded by the sum of absolute rewards:\n",
    "$$|G_t| \\leq \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\gamma^k |R_{t+k+1}| \\leq R_{\\max} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\gamma^k$$\n",
    "For $\\gamma < 1$, the geometric series $\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\gamma^k$ converges to $\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}$. Thus, $|G_t| \\leq \\frac{R_{\\max}}{1-\\gamma}$, which is a finite value."
